Input：The picture given by the question. 
Output：The time in the top left corner of the picture、Temperature of number one thermocouple and Temperature of number two thermocouple. 

1.Import the pictures, use the os.listdir function to get the name of all the images in the folder and connect to the folder path to read all the images. 
2.Cut the upper left text information section corp(1, 1, 102, 56) and save with the original file name. 
3.Call Baidu PaddlePaddle text recognition API, ocr=PaddleOCR, PaddleOCR model for text recognition. The model inputs a picture, recognises and returns text information in the picture. 
4.Batch read the text message images saved in Step 2. 
5.The text information images were inputted into the PaddleOCR model one by one, and three strings were identified. 
    result=ocr.ocr(image)
    data1=int(result[0][0][1][0][1:-1])
    data2=result[0][1][1][0][3:9]
    data3=result[0][2][1][0][3:9]
6.The text information is extracted by judgment. The first string intercepts the three digits of [1:4] directly as time, no further judgment is required, the second and third strings, starting with the character '丝',  are judged character by character backwards,
    if the character is not a number, delete it, at the same time from the back to the front character one by one, delete the end of the string of non-numeric characters. 
    while True: [data2[1:] if data2 the first character is not a number], [data2[:-1] if data2 the last character is not a number],
                [data3[1:] if data3 the first character is not a number], [data3[:-1] if data3 the last character is not a number]
7.Store the identified information into the dataframe. 
8.The dataframe is stored in Attachment 2, indexed by the identified time, corresponding to the time in Attachment 2.
